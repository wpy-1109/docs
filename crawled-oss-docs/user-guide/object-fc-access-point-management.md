-

The bucket owner creates an Object FC Access Point that is associated with a function created in Function Compute.

-

The Object FC Access Point is automatically created based on the specified settings.

-

The user sends a GetObject request to OSS by using the Object FC Access Point. OSS invokes the defined function to process and return requested data to the user.
