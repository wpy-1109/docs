# Bucket naming conventions

A bucket is a container that is used to store objects in Object Storage Service (OSS). Every object is contained in a bucket. You can configure a variety of bucket attributes such as the region, access control list (ACL), and storage class. You can create buckets of different storage classes to store data.

## Naming conventions


The maximum number of buckets that can be created by using an Alibaba Cloud account within a region is 100. After a bucket is created, its name cannot be modified. OSS supports the following bucket naming conventions:


-

The name must be globally unique in OSS.

-

The name can contain only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens (-).

-

The name must start and end with a lowercase letter or a digit.

-

The name must be 3 to 63 characters in length.

## Examples


The following examples of bucket names are valid:


-

examplebucket1

-

test-bucket-2021

-

aliyun-oss-bucket


The following examples show invalid bucket names and the reasons why the names are invalid:


-

Examplebucket1 (Uppercase letters are included.)

-

test_bucket_2021 (Underscores (_) are included.)

-

aliyun-oss-bucket- (The name ends with a hyphen (-).)
