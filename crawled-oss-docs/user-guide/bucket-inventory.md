# Obtain object information in a bucket using a bucket inventory

When a bucket contains millions or even billions of objects, listing them individually using the `ListObjects` API operation is slow and expensive. Bucket inventory is purpose-built for large-scale scenarios involving massive numbers of objects. It asynchronously and periodically scans a bucket to generate an inventory file. This file contains specified object metadata, such as object size, storage class, and encryption status. You can use this file for various purposes, including asset management, cost analysis, compliance audits, and preparing input for batch processing tasks.

## How it works


After you create an inventory rule, OSS automatically runs an inventory generation task daily or weekly. This task runs asynchronously in the background and does not affect normal access to the bucket. The workflow is as follows:


-

Obtain permissions: OSS assumes a pre-authorized RAM role to obtain permissions to scan the source bucket and write to the destination bucket.

-

Scan objects: OSS scans all matching objects in the source bucket based on the filter criteria defined in the rule, such as object prefix, version status, creation time, or size.

-

Generate inventory report: OSS aggregates the scan results to generate an inventory report. It then writes the report as a Gzip-compressed CSV file to the specified bucket.


Note the following when you use this feature:


-

Report snapshot: An inventory report is a snapshot of the bucket's state when the task starts. Changes to objects, such as additions, overwrites, or deletions, that occur during the scan are not guaranteed to be reflected in that report.

-

The first inventory report is typically generated soon after you configure the rule. Subsequent reports are generated in batches during the early morning hours (UTC+8) on a daily or weekly basis based on your configuration. The export latency is affected by the number of objects and the task queue.

## Step 1: Configure permissions


The authorization steps vary based on your identity:


-

Alibaba Cloud account: You only need to create a RAM role and grant it permissions so that OSS can assume the role.

-

RAM user: An administrator or the Alibaba Cloud account must first grant your account permissions to create inventories and manage RAM roles. Then, create a RAM role and grant it permissions.

#### A. Grant permissions to a RAM user (if applicable)


This step grants a RAM user the permissions to configure inventory rules and create the required RAM roles.
If you are using an Alibaba Cloud account, skip this step and proceed to the "Create and configure a RAM role" section.

Security recommendation: Granting permissions such as `ram:CreateRole` to a RAM user poses a security risk. We recommend that you use an Alibaba Cloud account to create the required RAM role in advance. After authorization, the RAM user can directly select this role when creating an inventory rule without having to create one. This is a more secure practice. If you still need to grant a RAM user the permission to create roles, perform the following steps:


-

Create a custom policy
Create the following custom policy in edit mode.

The `oss:ListBuckets` permission in the following policy is required only for operations via the console. This permission is not required if you use tools such as OSS SDKs or ossutil.

`json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "oss:PutBucketInventory",
                "oss:GetBucketInventory",
                "oss:DeleteBucketInventory",
                "oss:ListBuckets",
                "ram:CreateRole",
                "ram:AttachPolicyToRole",
                "ram:GetRole",
                "ram:ListPoliciesForRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "1"
}
`


Tip: If the current RAM user already has the `AliyunOSSFullAccess` system policy, you only need to grant the user the relevant permissions for role management:


`json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ram:CreateRole",
                "ram:AttachPolicyToRole",
                "ram:GetRole",
                "ram:ListPoliciesForRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "1"
}
`


-

Grant permissions to the RAM user


[Grant the permissions that you created to the target RAM user](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ram/user-guide/grant-permissions-to-the-ram-user).

#### B. Create and configure a RAM role


Allow OSS to write the generated inventory report to the destination bucket.


-

Go to the RAM console to create a role. Select Cloud Service for Principal Type, and Object Storage Service for Principal Name.

-

Create and attach a custom policy to the role. The content of this policy is as follows. Replace `your-destination-bucket` with the name of the bucket that is used to store inventory reports.


`json
{
  "Version": "1",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "oss:PutObject",
      "Resource": [
        "acs:oss:*:*:your-destination-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
`

KMS encryption: If you plan to use a KMS key to encrypt inventory files, you must grant the RAM role the `AliyunKMSFullAccess` permission or more fine-grained KMS-related permissions.
-

Record the ARN of the role, for example, `acs:ram::1234567890:role/oss-inventory-role`, for later use.


Security recommendation: When you configure an inventory rule for the first time in the console, the system guides you to automatically create a service-linked role named `AliyunOSSRole`. We do not recommend using the `AliyunOSSRole` that is automatically created in the console for production environments. This role has full management permissions on all buckets, which poses a significant security risk. We recommend that you use it only in testing environments.

## Step 2: Configure an inventory rule


You can configure an inventory rule using the OSS console, OSS SDKs, or ossutil. In the rule, you can set parameters such as the scan scope, frequency, and report content.

### Console


-

Log in to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.alibabacloud.com/).

-

Go to the source bucket for which you want to generate an inventory. In the navigation pane on the left, choose Data Management > Bucket Inventory.

-

On the Bucket Inventory page, click Create Inventory.

-

In the Create Inventory panel, configure the following parameters.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Set the status of the inventory task. Select Enable. |
| Rule Name | Set the name of the inventory task. The name can contain only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens (-). It cannot start or end with a hyphen (-). |
| Inventory Storage Bucket | Select the bucket to store the inventory files.The bucket for which the inventory is configured and the bucket where the inventory is stored must be in the same region and belong to the same Alibaba Cloud account. |
| Inventory Path | Set the storage path for the inventory report.To save the report to the `exampledir1/` path in the `examplebucket` bucket, enter exampledir1/. If the specified path does not exist in the bucket, OSS automatically creates it.If you leave this parameter empty, the report is saved in the root directory.Important To avoid affecting the normal use of the OSS-HDFS service or causing data contamination, do not set the inventory report directory to .dlsdata/ when you configure an inventory report rule for a bucket with OSS-HDFS enabled. |
| Frequency | Set the generation frequency for the inventory report. You can select Weekly or Daily. If the number of files exceeds ten billion, we recommend selecting Weekly to reduce costs and scan pressure. |
| Encryption Method | Select whether to encrypt the inventory file.None: Do not encrypt.AES256: Use the AES256 encryption algorithm to encrypt the inventory file.KMS: Use a KMS key to encrypt the inventory file. You can use an OSS-managed KMS key or create a KMS key in the same region as the destination bucket in the KMS platform.Note |
| Inventory Content | Select the file information you want to export, including Object Size, Storage Class, Last Modified Date, ETag, Multipart Upload Status, Encryption Status, Object ACL, Tag Count, File Type, and Crc64. |
| Match By Prefix | Optional. Scan only files under a specified prefix, such as exampledir1/. Leave this parameter empty to scan the entire bucket. If the set prefix does not match any object in the bucket, no inventory file is generated. |
| Configure Advanced Filtering | Important The following filter options are supported only in the China (Qingdao), China (Hohhot), and Germany (Frankfurt) regions.To filter exported files based on conditions such as file size or storage class, turn on the Configure Advanced Filtering switch.The supported filter options are described as follows:Time Range: Set the start and end dates for the last modification of the files to be exported. The time is accurate to the second.File Size Range: Set the minimum and maximum file sizes for the files to be exported.Note When setting the file size range, make sure that both the minimum and maximum file sizes are greater than 0 B, and the maximum value does not exceed 48.8 TB.Storage Class: Set the storage classes of the files to be exported. You can choose to export files of the Standard, Infrequent Access, Archive Storage, Cold Archive, and Deep Cold Archive storage classes. |
| Object Version | If versioning is enabled for the bucket, you can choose to export the Current Version or All Versions. |

Select I Understand And Agree To Grant Alibaba Cloud OSS Access To Bucket Resources, then click OK.


If a massive number of objects are involved, it takes some time to generate the inventory file. You can determine whether an inventory file has been generated in two ways. For more information, see [How do I determine whether an inventory file has been generated?](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/how-to-determine-whether-inventory-lists-are-generated#concept-2229272).

Note: For more information about the `put-bucket-inventory` command, see [put-bucket-inventory](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/put-bucket-inventory).
## API


The methods described above are fundamentally implemented based on the RESTful API, which you can directly call if your business requires a high level of customization. To directly call an API, you must include the signature calculation in your code.


-

[PutBucketInventory](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/putbucketinventory): Creates inventories.

-

[GetBucketInventory](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/getbucketinventory): Queries the inventories.

-

[DeleteBucketInventory](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/deletebucketinventory): Deletes  inventories.

-

[ListBucketInventory](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/listbucketinventory): Lists inventories.

## Step 3: Parse the inventory


The inventory task runs asynchronously. The core files include `manifest.json` and the `.csv.gz` data files in the `data/` directory. You can confirm that the report is complete by checking for the `manifest.json` file in the destination path.


Step 1: Read the `manifest.json` file


The column order in the inventory report is dynamic. This order depends on the fields you select when you configure the inventory rule. You must first parse the `manifest.json` file to determine the correct column order before you process the data files. This file contains the core metadata for the inventory task. Pay close attention to the following two fields:


-

`fileSchema`: A string that specifies the names and exact order of columns in the CSV file.

-

`files`: An array that lists the details of all `.csv.gz` data files generated for this report, including the path (`key`), size (`size`), and MD5 checksum (`MD5checksum`).


Sample file `manifest.json`:


`json
{
  "sourceBucket": "your-source-bucket",
  "destinationBucket": "your-destination-bucket",
  "version": "2019-09-01",
  "creationTimestamp": "1642994594",
  "fileFormat": "CSV",
  "fileSchema": "Bucket, Key, Size, LastModifiedDate, ETag, StorageClass, EncryptionStatus",
  "files": [
    {
      "key": "inventory-reports/your-source-bucket/daily-report/data/a1b2c3d4-....csv.gz",
      "size": 20480,
      "MD5checksum": "F77449179760C3B13F1E76110F07"
    }
  ]
}
`


Step 2: Parse the CSV data files according to`fileSchema`


-

Obtain and decompress the file:


From the `files` array in the `manifest.json` file, retrieve the `key` (file path) for each data file. Use this path to download the corresponding `.csv.gz` compressed package. Decompress the package to obtain the raw data in CSV format.
Important: The `Key` in the CSV file is URL-encoded. URL-decode it before use.
-

Parse the data in order:


Use the order of fields defined in the `fileSchema` as the column headings for the CSV file. Read the decompressed CSV file line by line. Each line represents a complete record of an object (file), and each column corresponds to a field specified in the `fileSchema`.


CSV content example:


If the `fileSchema` is `Bucket,Key,Size,StorageClass,LastModifiedDate`, the corresponding CSV content is formatted as follows:


`csv
"my-source-bucket","images/photo.jpg",102400,"Standard","2023-10-26T08:00:00.000Z"
"my-source-bucket","docs/report.pdf",2048000,"IA","2023-10-25T10:30:00.000Z"
`


## Inventory files


After the inventory task is configured, OSS generates inventory files according to the export frequency that is specified in the inventory rule. The directory structure of the inventory files is as follows:


`json
<dest-bucket-name>/
└── <dest-prefix>/
    └── <source-bucket-name>/
        └── <inventory-id>/
            ├── YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MMZ/  (Scan start time in UTC)
            │   ├── manifest.json   (Metadata file for the inventory task)
            │   └── manifest.checksum (MD5 checksum of the manifest.json file)
            └── data/
                └── <uuid>.csv.gz   (GZIP-compressed inventory data file)
`

-


| Directory Structure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dest-prefix | This directory corresponds to the destination prefix you configured. If the prefix is not set, this part of the path is omitted. |
| source-bucket-name/ | This directory corresponds to the source bucket name for which the inventory report is configured. |
| inventory_id/ | This directory corresponds to the rule name of the inventory task. |
| YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MMZ/ | This directory is a standard UTC timestamp, indicating the time when the bucket scan started, for example, 2020-05-17T16-00Z. This directory contains the manifest.json and manifest.checksum files. |
| data/ | This directory stores the inventory file, which contains a list of objects in the source bucket and the metadata for each object. The inventory file is a GZIP-compressed CSV file.Important When the number of objects in the source bucket to be exported is large, the program automatically chunks the inventory file into multiple compressed CSV files to facilitate user download and data processing. The compressed CSV files are named in increasing order, such as uuid.csv.gz, uuid-1.csv.gz, and uuid-2.csv.gz. You can get the list of CSV files from the manifest.json file, then decompress the CSV files and read the inventory data in order.The record information for a single object appears in only one inventory file and is not distributed across different inventory files. |


Descriptions of the files generated via bucket inventory are as follows:

### manifest files


Manifest files include manifest.json and manifest.checksum. The details are as follows:


-

manifest.json: provides metadata and other basic information about the inventory.


`json
{
    "creationTimestamp": "1642994594",
    "destinationBucket": "destbucket",
    "fileFormat": "CSV",
    "fileSchema": "Bucket, Key, VersionId, IsLatest, IsDeleteMarker, Size, StorageClass, LastModifiedDate, ETag, IsMultipartUploaded, EncryptionStatus, ObjectAcl, TaggingCount, ObjectType, Crc64",
    "files": [{
            "MD5checksum": "F77449179760C3B13F1E76110F07",
            "key": "destprefix/srcbucket/configid/data/a1574226-b5e5-40ee-91df-356845777c04.csv.gz",
            "size": 2046}],
    "sourceBucket": "srcbucket",
    "version": "2019-09-01"
}
`


The fields and descriptions are listed below:








-



-




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| creationTimestamp | The timestamp in epoch format that indicates when the scan of the source bucket started. |
| destinationBucket | The destination bucket where the inventory file is stored. |
| fileFormat | The format of the inventory file. |
| fileSchema | The fields included in the inventory file, divided into fixed fields and optional fields. The order of the fixed fields is fixed. The order of optional fields is determined by how you configure them in the inventory rule. To avoid data mismatches, always parse the CSV data columns based on the field order specified in fileSchema.If you select the current version for the object version when configuring the inventory rule, the fileSchema first lists the fixed fields Bucket, Key, followed by the optional fields.If you select all versions for the object version when configuring the inventory rule, the fileSchema first lists the fixed fields Bucket, Key, VersionId, IsLatest, IsDeleteMarker, followed by the optional fields. |
| files | Contains the MD5 hash, full path, and size of the inventory file. |
| sourceBucket | The source bucket for which the inventory rule is configured. |
| version | The version number of the inventory. |


-

manifest.checksum: contains the MD5 hash of the manifest.json file, for example, `8420A430CBD6B659A1C0DFC1C11A`.

### Inventory report


The inventory report is stored in the data/ directory and contains the file information that is exported by the inventory feature. An example of an inventory report is as follows:


![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9179474671/p1031726.png)


The order of the fields in the inventory report depends on the arrangement of the inventory content fields that you specified when you configured the inventory rule. In the inventory report example above, the fields are described from left to right as follows.

| Field Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bucket | The name of the source bucket for which the inventory task is executed. |
| Key | The name of the object in the bucket.The object name is URL-encoded. Decode it if required. |
| VersionId | The version ID of the object. This field appears only if the configured inventory rule is set to export all versions.If versioning is not enabled for the bucket where the inventory rule is configured, this field is empty.If versioning is enabled for the bucket where the inventory rule is configured, this field shows the object's versionId. |
| IsLatest | Specifies whether the object version is the latest version. This field appears only if the configured inventory rule is set to export all versions.If versioning is not enabled for the bucket where the inventory rule is configured, this field is true.If versioning is enabled for the bucket where the inventory rule is configured, and the object is the latest version, this field is true. If the object is a previous version, this field is false. |
| IsDeleteMarker | Specifies whether the object version is a delete marker. This field appears only if the configured inventory rule is set to export all versions.If versioning is not enabled for the bucket where the inventory rule is configured, this field is false by default.If versioning is enabled for the bucket where the inventory rule is configured, and the object is a delete marker, this field is true. If the object is not a delete marker, this field is false. |
| Size | The size of the object. |
| StorageClass | The storage class of the object. |
| LastModifiedDate | The last modified time of the object, in UTC format. |
| ETag | The ETag of the object.An ETag is created when an object is generated to identify its content. For objects created using the PutObject API operation, the ETag value is the MD5 hash of its content.For objects created by other means, the ETag value is a unique value generated based on a certain calculation rule, but it is not the MD5 hash of its content. |
| IsMultipartUploaded | Specifies whether the object was generated through a multipart upload. If so, this field is true; otherwise, it is false. |
| EncryptionStatus | Specifies whether the object is encrypted. If the object is encrypted, this field is true; otherwise, it is false. |

| TaggingCount | The number of object tags. |
| ObjectType | The object type. |
| Crc64 | The CRC-64 of the object. |


## Limitations


-

Number of rules: A single bucket supports up to 1,000 inventory rules configured via an API or SDK, or 10 inventory rules configured via the console.

-

Region restrictions: The source bucket and destination bucket must be in the same region and belong to the same Alibaba Cloud account. This feature is not supported for buckets that do not have a region attribute.

## Billing


Bucket inventory is free of charge, but you are charged for the following items:


-

API request fees: You are charged for `PUT` and `GET` requests when you configure or retrieve inventory rules. PUT request fees are incurred when OSS writes the inventory report to the destination bucket. GET request fees are incurred when you download and read the inventory report.

-

Storage fees: The generated inventory reports, including `manifest` files and `csv.gz` files, consume storage space in the destination bucket and are billed at standard storage rates.

-

Outbound traffic fees: Outbound traffic fees are incurred when you download and read the inventory report using a public endpoint.


To avoid unnecessary costs, you can delete inventory rules that are no longer needed. You can also use lifecycle rules to automatically clean up expired inventory report files.

## Apply in production

### Best practices


-

Least privilege: Always use a dedicated RAM role with the least privilege. Do not use `AliyunOSSRole` in a production environment.

-

Performance recommendations: For source buckets with high traffic, store the inventory report in a separate, dedicated bucket. This avoids bandwidth contention from writing the report, which could affect online services.

-

Cost optimization: Bucket inventory supports exporting inventory files daily or weekly. For buckets with over ten billion files, prioritize a weekly inventory. Also, configure a lifecycle rule on the destination bucket to automatically delete inventory reports older than N days, for example, 30 days, to save on storage costs.

| --- | --- |
| <10 billion | Configure daily or weekly exports as needed |
| 10 billion to 50 billion | Export weekly |
| Greater than or equal to 50 billion | Export in batches by matching prefixes to increase the limit on the number of files that can be exported from a bucket |


-

Prefix partitioning: For very large buckets, for example, with hundreds of billions of files, you can create multiple inventory rules based on business prefixes. This lets you generate reports in a divide-and-conquer manner, which makes them easier to manage and process.

### Risk prevention


-

Data audit: The inventory report reflects the state of the bucket when the scan begins. Objects modified after the scan's start time (`createTimeStamp` in `manifest.json`) may not be included in the report. Before performing critical operations based on an inventory report, such as deletions, we recommend you first verify the object's current state by calling the [HeadObject](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/headobject#reference-bgh-cbw-wdb) API operation.

-

Monitoring and alerts: Monitor the storage usage of the destination bucket to prevent the unlimited growth of inventory files, which can lead to uncontrolled costs. You can also monitor calls to APIs such as `PutBucketInventory` to track configuration changes.

-

Change management: Changes to inventory rules, such as modifications to prefixes or frequencies, affect downstream data analytics workflows. All changes must be included in version control and review processes.
