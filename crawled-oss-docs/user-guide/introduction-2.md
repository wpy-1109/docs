# What is Audio and video processing?

Audio and video processing provided by Intelligent Media Management (IMM) allows you to process videos of multiple formats. You can upload and save original videos to Object Storage Service (OSS) and initiate video transcoding or other requests at any time, anywhere, and on any internet-connected device by calling the `x-oss-async-process` operation. You can also call `x-oss-process` to play the source video immediately after you upload the video.


## Scenarios


-
#### Adaption to different terminal devices and network environments


You can convert the frame rate and bitrate to adapt to various devices and network conditions.

-
#### Efficient encoding for reduced costs


Media processing uses efficient encoding algorithms to reduce the bitrate and stuttering in playback without compromising the video quality. This reduces storage and traffic costs.

-
#### Smart production technologies for video enhancement and reproduction


You can transcode a poor-quality video to a version that has a higher definition, and generate new media files by taking snapshots or editing. These are implemented based on smart production technologies, such as video AI and super-resolution technology.

-
#### Real-time transcoding and real-time playback


The live transcoding technology is used to achieve on-demand real-time transcoding and real-time playback, which reduces transcoding and storage costs and improves the playback experience.

## How media processing works


Offline transcoding: Upload a video to a bucket and create an audio and video transcoding task. After the task is executed, the transcoded video is stored in OSS.

Live transcoding: Upload a video to a bucket and create a live transcoding playlist. In this case, the video is immediately played when you start to upload the video. The video is transcoded on demand in real time and the transcoded video is stored in OSS.

## Processing parameters


OSS allows you to use one or more parameters to process media files, such as videos. You can also specify multiple processing parameters in a style to process multiple media files at a time. For more information, see [Styles](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/styles).


If you specify multiple parameters, OSS processes the media file based on the parameters in the order in which you specify the parameters. The following table describes the parameters.

## Methods


-

You can call the x-oss-async-process operation to process videos. For more information, see [Asynchronous processing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/asynchronous-processing).

-

You can call the x-oss-process operation to process videos. For more information, see [Synchronous processing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/synchronous-processing).

-

You can use batch processing to process existing videos. For more information, see [Batch processing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/batch-processing).

-

You can create a trigger to process incremental videos. For more information, see [Trigger](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/triggers).
