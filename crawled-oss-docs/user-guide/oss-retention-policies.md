# Use retention policies (WORM) to prevent modification and deletion of OSS data within a specified period

The Object Storage Service (OSS) retention policy, also known as Write Once Read Many (WORM), makes data immutable, preventing it from being modified or deleted by any user, including the bucket owner. During the retention period, you can only upload and read objects. Objects can be modified or deleted only after the retention period expires.

## Use cases


WORM helps enterprises meet the regulatory and compliance requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). This feature is suitable for sectors such as finance, insurance, healthcare, and securities, and for scenarios such as Multi-Layer Protection Scheme (MLPS) audits of log data.


> NOTE:

> NOTE: 


> NOTE: Note 

OSS is accredited and audited by Cohasset Associates and meets the stringent requirements for the retention of electronic records. OSS buckets with configured retention policies comply with regulations, such as SEC Rule 17a-4(f), FINRA Rule 4511, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Rule 1.31. For more information, see the [OSS Cohasset Assessment Report](https://gosspublic.alicdn.com/OSSCohassetAssessmentReport.pdf).


## Prerequisites


Ensure that versioning is either enabled or disabled for the bucket where you want to set a retention policy. You cannot set a retention policy if versioning is suspended. For more information about versioning, see [Versioning](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/overview-78/#concept-jdg-4rx-bgb).

## Usage notes


-

You can configure retention policies only for buckets.

-

You cannot enable OSS-HDFS and configure a retention policy for the same bucket.

-

During the retention period, you can [configure lifecycle rules](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/lifecycle-rules-based-on-the-last-modified-time#concept-y2g-szy-5db) to change the storage classes of objects in the bucket to reduce storage costs and ensure compliance.

## Retention policy description


-

Implementation


After creation, a retention policy enters a 24-hour InProgress state. During this time, the data is protected, but the policy itself can be modified or deleted.


-

Within 24 hours after the retention policy is created


-

If the retention policy is not locked, the bucket owner and authorized users can delete the policy.

-

If the retention policy is locked, the policy cannot be deleted and its retention period cannot be shortened. However, the retention period can be extended. Data in the bucket is protected by the retention policy. If you attempt to delete or modify data in the bucket, the `409 FileImmutable` error is returned.

-

More than 24 hours after the retention policy is created


If a policy is not locked within this 24-hour window, it automatically expires and becomes invalid.

-

Deletion


-

A time-based retention policy is a metadata attribute of a bucket. If a bucket is deleted, the retention policy of the bucket is also deleted.

-

If the retention policy is not locked within 24 hours after the policy is created, the bucket owner and authorized users can delete the policy.

-

If a bucket contains objects that are protected by the retention policy, you cannot delete the bucket or the retention policy.

-

Example


Suppose you create a retention policy with a 30-day retention period for a bucket on June 1, 2022, and lock the policy immediately. You upload three objects, file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt, at different times. The following table lists the upload dates and expiration dates of the objects.











| Object name | Upload date | Expiration date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file1.txt | April 1, 2022 | April 30, 2022 |
| file2.txt | June 1, 2022 | June 30, 2022 |
| file3.txt | September 1, 2022 | September 30, 2022 |


## Methods

### Use the OSS console


-

Create a retention policy.


-

Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.alibabacloud.com/).

-

Click Buckets, and then click the name of the destination bucket.

-

In the navigation pane on the left, choose Content Security > Retention Policy.

-

On the Retention Policy page, click Create Policy.

-

In the Create Policy dialog box, specify a Retention Period.


> NOTE:

> NOTE: 


> NOTE: Note 

The retention period is measured in days. Valid values: 1 to 25,550.


-

Click OK.


> NOTE:

> NOTE: 


> NOTE: Note 

The policy state is InProgress. This state is valid for 24 hours. During this period, the bucket's resources are protected. If you decide not to keep the policy, delete it within 24 hours.


-

Lock the retention policy.


-

Click Lock.

-

In the dialog box that appears, click OK.


> IMPORTANT:

> NOTE: 


> NOTE: Important 

After a retention policy is locked, you cannot modify or delete it. You also cannot modify or delete data in the bucket during the retention period.


-

(Optional) Modify the retention period.


-

Click Edit.

-

In the dialog box that appears, modify the retention period.


> IMPORTANT:

> NOTE: 


> NOTE: Important 

You can only extend the retention period. You cannot shorten it.


### Use OSS SDKs


The following sample code provides examples of how to configure retention policies using OSS SDKs for common programming languages.

### Use ossutil


Use ossutil to create a WORM policy. For more information, see [Install ossutil](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/install-ossutil2#DAS).


The following command creates a new WORM policy in the `examplebucket` and sets the retention period to 365 days.


`bash
ossutil api initiate-bucket-worm --bucket examplebucket --initiate-worm-configuration "{\"RetentionPeriodInDays\":\"365\"}"
`


For more information about this command, see [initiate-bucket-worm](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/initiate-bucket-worm).

## Related API


The preceding operations are based on API operations. If your program has high customization requirements, you can directly make REST API requests. To make REST API requests, you must manually write code to calculate signatures. For more information, see [InitiateBucketWorm](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/initiatebucketworm#reference-2536872).

## Working with versioning


For use cases like protecting backups (such as Veeam), tracking asset modifications, or meeting financial compliance, you often need to allow data updates while making all historical versions immutable. To achieve this, enable both a retention policy and versioning on your bucket. Versioning retains old versions when an object is overwritten or deleted, rather than permanently erasing them. The retention policy then applies a protection period to all versions, making them unchangeable and non-deletable.


When versioning and retention policies are configured to work together, they follow these principles:


-

Order of enabling features: There are no constraints on the order in which you enable versioning and retention policies. Configure them flexibly as needed.

-

State transition constraints:


-

After a retention policy is locked, you cannot change the versioning state from Enabled to Suspended.

-

You can enable a retention policy for a bucket whose versioning is Suspended. After the policy is enabled, you can change the versioning state to Enabled.

-

Object version protection mechanism:


-

A retention policy protects all versions of an object. No version can be deleted or modified during the protection period.

-

You can upload an object with the same name to create a new version. The new version is also protected by the retention policy.

-

Retention policies do not apply to delete markers. The deletion of delete markers is not restricted by retention policies.

-

Data replication synergy:


-

Both the source and destination buckets support independent configurations for versioning and retention policies.

-

Version information is transmitted normally during replication. The destination bucket manages versions based on its own configuration.

-

Version deletion operations in the source bucket are not synchronized to a destination bucket that has a retention policy enabled.

## FAQ

### How are object deletion operations handled when a retention policy and versioning are enabled at the same time?


When a retention policy and versioning are enabled at the same time, deleting an object has the following effects:


-

The deletion operation creates a delete marker but does not physically delete the historical versions of the object.

-

The retention policy does not protect delete markers. Delete markers can be deleted.

-

All object versions cannot be deleted during the retention policy's protection period, even if a delete marker exists.

-

Lifecycle management can delete dangling delete markers, but it cannot delete object versions protected by a retention policy.

### After a retention policy is enabled, can the versioning state still be modified?


After a retention policy is enabled, the following constraints apply to modifying the versioning state:


-

Enabled to Suspended: If the versioning state is "Enabled", you cannot change it to "Suspended" after the retention policy is locked.

-

Suspended to Enabled: If the versioning state is "Suspended", you can still change it to "Enabled" after enabling the retention policy.

-

Disabled to Enabled: For a bucket with versioning disabled, you can enable versioning after you configure a retention policy.

### Does using a retention policy with versioning increase storage costs?


This incurs the following additional storage costs:


-

All object versions are retained during the retention policy's protection period and cannot be deleted by lifecycle rules.

-

The accumulation of versions can lead to a significant increase in storage usage, especially for frequently updated objects.

-

Set a reasonable retention period for the retention policy and use lifecycle rules to manage storage class transitions to optimize costs.

### What are the benefits of a retention policy?


A retention policy provides secure and compliant data storage. Within the retention period of a retention policy, data cannot be modified or deleted. If you use Resource Access Management (RAM) policies and bucket policies to protect data, data can still be modified or deleted.

### In what scenarios do I need a retention policy?


Configure a retention policy for a bucket if you want to store important data, such as medical records, technical documents, and contracts, for a long period and prevent the data from being modified or deleted.

### Can I delete a retention policy?


It depends on the status of the retention policy.


-

Not locked: The bucket owner and authorized users can delete the policy.

-

Locked: No one can delete the policy.

### Can I configure a retention policy for an object?


No. You can configure retention policies only for buckets, not for directories or individual objects.

### How do I calculate the retention time of an object?


The retention expiration time is calculated based on the last modified time of the object and the retention period of the retention policy. For example, if a bucket has a retention policy of 10 days and an object in the bucket was last modified on February 15, 2022, the object is retained until February 25, 2022.

### How do I delete a bucket that has a retention policy?


-

If an object is not stored, delete it directly.

-

If the bucket contains objects and their protection period has expired, you must first delete all objects before deleting the bucket.

-

You cannot delete an object during its protection period.

### If my account has an overdue payment, are my WORM-protected objects safe?


No. If your account has an overdue payment, all data may be deleted according to Alibaba Cloud's [service suspension rules for overdue payments](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/overdue-payments), regardless of any retention policy.

### Can an authorized RAM user configure a retention policy?


Yes. Retention policy APIs are available and support RAM policies. An authorized RAM user can create or delete a retention policy in the console or using APIs or SDKs.
