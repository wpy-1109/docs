Response parameters

Parameter

	

Type

	

Description




ReplicationProgress

	

Container

	

The container that is used to store the progress of data replication tasks.

Parent nodes: none

Child nodes: Rule




Rule

	

Container

	

The container that stores the progress of the data replication task corresponding to each data replication rule.

Parent nodes: ReplicationConfiguration

Child nodes: ID, Destination, Status, and Progress




ID

	

String

	

The ID of the data replication rule.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: none




PrefixSet

	

Container

	

The container that stores prefixes. You can specify up to 10 prefixes in each data replication rule.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: Prefix




Prefix

	

String

	

The prefix that is used to specify the object to replicate. Only objects that match the prefix are replicated to the destination bucket.

Parent nodes: PrefixSet

Child nodes: none




Action

	

String

	

The operations that are synchronized to the destination bucket.

You can set Action to one or more of the following operation types. Default value: ALL.

ALL: PUT, DELETE, and ABORT operations are synchronized to the destination bucket.

PUT: Write operations are synchronized to the destination bucket, including PutObject, PostObject, AppendObject, CopyObject, PutObjectACL, InitiateMultipartUpload, UploadPart, UploadPartCopy, and CompleteMultipartUpload.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: none




Destination

	

Container

	

The container that stores information about the destination bucket.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: Bucket and Location




Bucket

	

String

	

The destination bucket to which the data is replicated.

Parent nodes: Destination

Child nodes: none




Location

	

String

	

The region in which the destination bucket is located.

Parent nodes: Destination

Child nodes: none




TransferType

	

String

	

The data transfer type that is used to transfer data in data replication.

internal: the data transfer type that uses the default data transfer link of Object Storage Service (OSS).

oss_acc: the link in which data transmission is accelerated. You can set the TransferType parameter to oss_acc only when you create CRR rules.




HistoricalObjectReplication

	

String

	

Indicates whether historical data from the source bucket is replicated to the destination bucket before data replication is enabled.

Default value: enabled. Valid values:

enabled: indicates that historical data is replicated to the destination bucket.

disabled: indicates that historical data is not replicated to the destination bucket. Only data uploaded to the source bucket after data replication is enabled for the source bucket is replicated.




Progress

	

Container

	

The container that stores the progress of the data replication task. This parameter is returned only when the data replication task is in the doing state.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: HistoricalObject and NewObject




HistoricalObject

	

String

	

The percentage of the replicated historical data. This element is valid only when HistoricalObjectReplication is set to enabled.

Parent nodes: Progress

Child nodes: none




NewObject

	

String

	

The time used to determine whether data is replicated to the destination bucket. Data that is written to the source bucket before the time is replicated to the destination bucket. The value of this element is in the GMT format.

Example: Thu, 24 Sep 2015 15:39:18 GMT.

Parent nodes: Progress

Child nodes: none
