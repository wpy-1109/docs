# PutBucketTransferAcceleration

You can call this operation to configure transfer acceleration for a bucket. After you enable transfer acceleration for a bucket, users worldwide can access objects more quickly. The transfer acceleration feature is applicable to scenarios where data needs to be transferred over long geographical distances. This feature can also be used to download or upload objects that are gigabytes or terabytes in size.

Usage notes

After you enable transfer acceleration for a bucket, you can use an accelerate endpoint in addition to the default endpoint to access the bucket. The access speed is accelerated only when you use the accelerate endpoint.

You are charged for the transfer acceleration fees when you use the accelerate endpoint to access a bucket. For more information, see Transfer acceleration fees.

For more information about transfer acceleration, see Transfer acceleration.

Permissions
