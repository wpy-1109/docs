Request parameters

Parameter

	

Type

	

Description




delimiter

	

String

	

The character used to group objects by name. If you specify the Delimiter parameter in the request, the response contains the CommonPrefixes element. Objects whose names contain the same string from the prefix to the next occurrence of the delimiter are grouped as a single result element in CommonPrefixes.




max-uploads

	

Integer

	

The maximum number of multipart upload tasks that can be returned for the current request. Default value: 1000. Maximum value: 1000.




key-marker

	

String

	

This parameter is used together with the upload-id-marker parameter to specify the position from which the next list begins.

If the upload-id-marker parameter is not set, Object Storage Service (OSS) returns all multipart upload tasks in which object names are alphabetically after the key-marker value.

If the upload-id-marker parameter is set, the response includes the following tasks:

Multipart upload tasks in which object names are alphabetically after the key-marker value in alphabetical order

Multipart upload tasks in which object names are the same as the key-marker parameter value but whose upload IDs are greater than the upload-id-marker parameter value




prefix

	

String

	

The prefix that the returned object names must contain. If you specify a prefix in the request, the specified prefix is included in the response.

Note

You can use prefixes to group and manage objects in buckets in the same way you manage a folder in a file system.




upload-id-marker

	

String

	

The upload ID of the multipart upload task after which the list begins. This parameter is used together with the key-marker parameter.

If the key-marker parameter is not set, OSS ignores the upload-id-marker parameter.

If the key-marker parameter is configured, the query result includes:

Multipart upload tasks in which object names are alphabetically after the key-marker value in alphabetical order

Multipart upload tasks in which object names are the same as the key-marker parameter value but whose upload IDs are greater than the upload-id-marker parameter value




encoding-type

	

String

	

The encoding type of the object name in the response. Values of Delimiter, KeyMarker, Prefix, NextKeyMarker, and Key can be encoded in UTF-8. However, the XML 1.0 standard cannot be used to parse control characters such as characters with an American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) value from 0 to 10. You can set the encoding-type parameter to encode values of Delimiter, KeyMarker, Prefix, NextKeyMarker, and Key in the response.

Default value: null

Key

	

String

	

The name of the object for which a multipart upload task was initiated.

Parent nodes: Upload

Note

The results returned by OSS are listed in ascending alphabetical order of object names. Multiple multipart upload tasks that are initiated to upload the same object are listed in ascending order of upload IDs.
