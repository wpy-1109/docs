# DeleteBucketReplication

You can call this operation to disable data replication for a bucket and delete the data replication rule configured for the bucket. After the data replication rule is deleted, all operations performed in the source bucket are not synchronized to the destination bucket.

Usage notes

200 OK is returned if no data replication rules are configured.

DeleteBucketReplication does not immediately delete a data replication rule. OSS takes a period of time to clear the data replication task executed based on the rule. During the process, the data replication task is in the closing state. After the data replication task is cleared, the data replication rule is deleted.

If you call DeleteBucketReplication to delete a data replication rule that corresponds to a data replication task in the closing state, 204 NoContent is returned.
