Description




ReplicationConfiguration

	

Container

	

N/A

	

The container that stores data replication configurations.

Parent nodes: none

Child nodes: Rule




Rule

	

Container

	

N/A

	

The container that stores the data replication rules.

Parent nodes: ReplicationConfiguration

Child nodes: Destination, HistoricalObjectReplication, Status, and ID




ID

	

String

	

test_replication_1

	

The ID of the data replication rule.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: none




PrefixSet

	

Container

	

N/A

	

The container that stores prefixes. You can specify up to 10 prefixes in each data replication rule.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: Prefix




Prefix

	

String

	

source1

	

The prefixes of the objects that are replicated to the destination bucket.

Parent nodes: PrefixSet

Child nodes: none




Action

	

String

	

PUT

	

The operations that are synchronized to the destination bucket.

You can set the Action parameter to one or more of the following operation types. Default value: ALL.

ALL: indicates that the PUT, DELETE, and ABORT operations are synchronized to the destination bucket.

PUT: indicates that write operations are synchronized to the destination bucket, including the PutObject, PostObject, AppendObject, CopyObject, PutObjectACL, InitiateMultipartUpload, UploadPart, UploadPartCopy, and CompleteMultipartUpload operations.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: none




Status

	

String

	

doing

	

The status of the data replication task.

Valid values:

starting: OSS creates a data replication task after a data replication rule is configured. In this case, the state of the task is starting.

doing: The state of a data replication task after a data replication rule takes effect. In this case, the state of the task is doing.

closing: OSS clears a data replication task after the corresponding data replication rule is deleted. In this case, the state of the task is closing.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: none




Destination

	

Container

	

N/A

	

The container that stores information about the destination bucket.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: Bucket and Location




Bucket

	

String

	

destbucket

	

The destination bucket to which data is replicated.

Parent nodes: Destination

Child nodes: none




Location

	

String

	

oss-cn-beijing

	

The region in which the destination bucket is located.

Parent nodes: Destination

Child nodes: none




TransferType

	

String

	

oss_acc

	

The data transfer type that is used to transfer data in data replication. The TransferType parameter is contained in the response only when the value of the TransferType parameter is set to oss_acc in the request.

Default value: internal. Valid values:

internal: the data transfer type that uses the default data transfer link of OSS.

oss_acc: the link in which data transmission is accelerated. You can set the TransferType parameter to oss_acc only when you create CRR rules.




HistoricalObjectReplication

	

String

	

disabled

	

Indicates whether historical data from the source bucket is replicated to the destination bucket before data replication is enabled. Default value: enabled.

Default value: disabled. Valid values:

enabled: indicates that historical data is replicated to the destination bucket.

disabled: indicates that historical data is not replicated to the destination bucket. Only data uploaded to the source bucket after data replication is enabled for the source bucket is replicated.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: none




SyncRole

	

String

	

aliyunramrole

	

The role that is used for data replication. The parameter is contained in the response only when the destination object is encrypted by using server-side encryption (SSE) that uses customer master keys (CMKs) managed by Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption (SSE-KMS).




RTC

	

Container

	

N/A

	

The container that stores the status of the RTC feature.

Parent nodes: Rule

Child nodes: Status




Status

	

String

	

enbaled
