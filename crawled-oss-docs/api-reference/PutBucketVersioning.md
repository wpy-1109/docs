# PutBucketVersioning

Configures the versioning state for a bucket.

Usage notes

Before you configure the versioning state for a bucket, you must have the PutBucketVersioning permission.

A bucket can be in one of the following versioning states: disabled, enabled, or suspended. By default, versioning is disabled for a bucket.

If versioning is enabled for a bucket, OSS generates unique version IDs for all objects that are added to the bucket. In this case, OSS stores multiple versions of the objects.

If versioning is suspended for a bucket, OSS generates the version ID null for all objects that are added to the bucket. In this case, OSS does not store new versions for objects that are deleted or overwritten.

For more information about versioning, see Versioning.
