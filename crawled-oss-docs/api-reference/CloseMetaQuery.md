# CloseMetaQuery

Disables the metadata management feature for an Object Storage Service (OSS) bucket. After the metadata management feature is disabled for a bucket, OSS automatically deletes the metadata index library of the bucket. After the metadata index library is deleted, you cannot perform metadata indexing.

Usage notes

To disable the metadata management feature for a bucket, you must have the oss:CloseMetaQuery permission. For more information, see Common examples of RAM policies.

HTTP status code 200 is returned when you call the CloseMetaQuery operation to disable the metadata management feature, regardless of whether the metadata management feature is enabled for a bucket.

This operation is an asynchronous operation and does not immediately take effect. After you call the CloseMetaQuery operation, it takes some time for OSS to delete the metadata index library.
