# OpenMetaQuery

Call the OpenMetaQuery operation to enable the metadata management feature for a bucket and select a retrieval mode. After you enable this feature, Object Storage Service (OSS) creates a metadata index library for the bucket. OSS then builds metadata indexes for all objects in the bucket. After the index library is created, OSS performs Near Real-Time incremental scans to track and build indexes for new objects.

Notes

By default, an Alibaba Cloud account has the permission to enable the metadata management feature. If you want to use a Resource Access Management (RAM) user to enable this feature, make sure that the RAM user is granted the oss:OpenMetaQuery permission. For more information, see Grant custom permissions to a RAM user.

For more information about data indexing, see Data indexing.
