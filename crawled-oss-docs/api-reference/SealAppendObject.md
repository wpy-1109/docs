# Object-level operations

Call the SealAppendObject operation to stop appending content to an Appendable Object. After this operation is called, the object becomes non-appendable. This lets you use a lifecycle rule to change the object's storage class to Cold Archive or Deep Cold Archive to reduce storage costs. Before you seal an Appendable Object, you can change its storage class only to Infrequent Access (IA) or Archive Storage.

Important

To call the SealAppendObject operation, submit a ticket to request access.

Permissions

By default, an Alibaba Cloud account has full permissions. RAM users or RAM roles under an Alibaba Cloud account do not have any permissions by default. The Alibaba Cloud account or account administrator must grant operation permissions through RAM Policy or Bucket policies.
