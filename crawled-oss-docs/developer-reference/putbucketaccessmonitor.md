# Call PutBucketAccessMonitor to enable or disable access tracking for a bucket

Enables or disables access tracking for a bucket. If access tracking is enabled for a bucket, OSS records the last access time of objects in the bucket. In this case, you can configure lifecycle rules based on last access time to identify hot and cold data based on data access patterns and move cold data to a more cost-effective storage class.

## Usage notes


To enable or disable access tracking for a bucket, you must have the `oss:PutBucketAccessMonitor` permission. For more information, see [Attach a custom policy to a RAM user](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/common-examples-of-ram-policies#section-ucu-jv0-zip).

| Element | Type | Required | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AccessMonitorConfiguration | Container | Yes | N/A | The access tracking configurations of the bucket. Child nodes: Status |
| Status | String | Yes | Enabled | Specifies whether to enable access tracking for the bucket. Valid values:Enabled: enables access tracking.OSS initially uses the time when access tracking is enabled as the last access time of objects in the bucket and updates the last access time of an object if the object is accessed. The last access time of an object is updated asynchronously. If an object is accessed several times within a period of 24 hours, only the first access operation on the object within the period updates the last access time. You can specify a lifecycle rule based on last access time for the bucket. Disabled: disables access tracking.Access tracking can be disabled only if the bucket does not have a lifecycle rule that is based on last access time. Parent nodes: AccessMonitorConfiguration |
