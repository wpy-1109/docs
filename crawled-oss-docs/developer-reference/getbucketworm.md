You can call this operation to query the retention policy configured for the specified bucket.

> NOTE: Note 

If the retention policy specified by the ID in the request does not exist, OSS returns 404.


##  Usage notes


OSS supports the Write Once Read Many (WORM) strategy that prevents an object from being deleted or overwritten for a specified period of time. You can configure a time-based retention policy for a bucket. A retention policy has a retention period that ranges from one day to 70 years.


After a retention policy configured for a bucket is locked, you can read objects from or upload objects to the bucket. However, the retention policy and objects in the bucket cannot be deleted within the retention period. You can delete objects in the bucket only after the retention period expires.
