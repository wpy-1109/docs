# Call the DoMetaQuery operation to query objects that meet specified conditions and list the object information based on a specified field and sorting order.

Call the DoMetaQuery operation to query objects that meet specified conditions and list the object information based on a specified field and sorting order. You can also use nested Query elements to perform complex queries and use aggregate operations to collect and analyze statistics on the values of different fields.

## Precautions


To query objects that meet specified conditions, you must have the `oss:DoMetaQuery` permission. For more information, see [Grant custom permissions to a RAM user](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/common-examples-of-ram-policies#section-ucu-jv0-zip).

## Query examples


You can nest Query elements to build complex query conditions and precisely query for the content you need.


-

To search for an object named exampleobject.txt that is smaller than 1000 bytes, configure the Query element as follows:


`plaintext

{
  "SubQueries":[
    {
      "Field":"Filename",
      "Value": "exampleobject.txt",
      "Operation":"eq"
    },
    {
      "Field":"Size",
      "Value":"1000",
      "Operation":"lt"
    }
  ],
  "Operation":"and"
}

`


-

To search for objects that have the `exampledir/` prefix, contain the `type=document` or `owner=John` tag, and are larger than 10 MB, configure the Query element as follows:


`plaintext

{
  "SubQueries": [
    {
      "Field": "Filename",
      "Value": "exampledir/",
      "Operation": "prefix"
    },
    {
      "Field": "Size",
      "Value": "1048576",
      "Operation": "gt"
    },
    {
      "SubQueries": [
        {
          "Field": "OSSTagging.type",
          "Value": "document",
          "Operation": "eq"
        },
        {
          "Field": "OSSTagging.owner",
          "Value": "John",
          "Operation": "eq"
        }
      ],
      "Operation": "or"
    }
  ],
  "Operation": "and"
}


`


In addition to these search conditions, you can use aggregate operations to perform statistical analysis on different data. For example, you can calculate the total size, count, average value, or maximum or minimum value of all objects that meet the search criteria, or collect statistics on the size distribution of all images that meet the search criteria.

## SDK


The following SDKs are available for this operation:


-

[Java](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/data-indexing-2)

-

[Python V2](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/data-indexing-using-oss-sdk-for-python-v2)

-

[Go V2](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/data-indexing-3)

-

PHP V2

## ossutil command-line tool


The DoMetaQuery operation corresponds to the [do-meta-query](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/do-meta-query) command in ossutil.
