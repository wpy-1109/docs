# Stop appending content to an Appendable Object

Call the SealAppendObject operation to stop appending content to an Appendable Object. After this operation is called, the object becomes non-appendable. This lets you use a lifecycle rule to change the object's storage class to Cold Archive or Deep Cold Archive to reduce storage costs. Before you seal an Appendable Object, you can change its storage class only to Infrequent Access (IA) or Archive Storage.

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| HeadObject | For an object that has been sealed using the SealAppendObject operation, HeadObject returns the x-oss-sealed-time header. Otherwise, this header is not returned. |
| GetObject | For an object that has been sealed using the SealAppendObject operation, GetObject returns the x-oss-sealed-time header. Otherwise, this header is not returned. |
