# CloseMetaQuery

Disables the metadata management feature for an Object Storage Service (OSS) bucket. After the metadata management feature is disabled for a bucket, OSS automatically deletes the metadata index library of the bucket. After the metadata index library is deleted, you cannot perform metadata indexing.

## Usage notes


-

To disable the metadata management feature for a bucket, you must have the `oss:CloseMetaQuery` permission. For more information, see [Common examples of RAM policies](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/common-examples-of-ram-policies#section-ucu-jv0-zip).

-

HTTP status code 200 is returned when you call the CloseMetaQuery operation to disable the metadata management feature, regardless of whether the metadata management feature is enabled for a bucket.

-

This operation is an asynchronous operation and does not immediately take effect. After you call the CloseMetaQuery operation, it takes some time for OSS to delete the metadata index library.
