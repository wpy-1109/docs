# Enable the metadata management feature and select a retrieval mode

Call the OpenMetaQuery operation to enable the metadata management feature for a bucket and select a retrieval mode. After you enable this feature, Object Storage Service (OSS) creates a metadata index library for the bucket. OSS then builds metadata indexes for all objects in the bucket. After the index library is created, OSS performs Near Real-Time incremental scans to track and build indexes for new objects.

## Notes


-

By default, an Alibaba Cloud account has the permission to enable the metadata management feature. If you want to use a Resource Access Management (RAM) user to enable this feature, make sure that the RAM user is granted the `oss:OpenMetaQuery` permission. For more information, see [Grant custom permissions to a RAM user](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/common-examples-of-ram-policies#section-ucu-jv0-zip).
