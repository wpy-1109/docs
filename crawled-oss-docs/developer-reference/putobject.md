# Object Storage Service PutObject API

Use the PutObject API to upload a file to an Object Storage Service (OSS) bucket. The maximum size of a file that can be uploaded in a single operation is 5 GB.

## Request syntax


`http
PUT /ObjectName HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: ContentLength
Content-Type: ContentType
Host: BucketName.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com
Date: GMT Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
`


## Usage notes


-

The maximum size of a file that can be uploaded in a single operation is 5 GB. To upload a file larger than 5 GB, use the multipart upload feature.

-

When you upload a file with the same name as an existing file, the existing file is overwritten by default and a 200 OK status code is returned. You can set a parameter to prevent overwrites to avoid accidentally overwriting important files.

-

OSS uses a flat storage structure and does not have directories like a traditional file system. You can simulate a folder structure by creating an empty object that ends with a forward slash (/).

#### Permissions


An Alibaba Cloud account has full permissions by default. However, a Resource Access Management (RAM) user or RAM role under the account has no permissions until they are granted by the Alibaba Cloud account or an administrator using a [RAM Policy](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/ram-policy-overview/) or a [Bucket Policy](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/oss-bucket-policy/).





























| API | Action | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PutObject | oss:PutObject | Uploads an object. |
| oss:PutObjectTagging | When uploading an object, if you specify object tags through x-oss-tagging, this permission is required. |
| kms:GenerateDataKey | When uploading an object, if the object metadata contains X-Oss-Server-Side-Encryption: KMS, these two permissions are required. |
| kms:Decrypt |


#### Versioning


In a bucket with versioning enabled, OSS automatically generates a unique version ID for each new object. This ID is returned in the x-oss-version-id response header.


In a bucket with versioning suspended, the version ID of a new object is null. OSS ensures that only one null version of an object exists.

## Request parameters


OSS supports standard HTTP request headers such as `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `Content-Encoding`, `Content-Disposition`, and `Content-Type`. If you set these request headers, their values are automatically applied when the file is downloaded.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization | String | No | OSS qn6q:77Dv | Indicates that the request has been authenticated and authorized. For more information about how to calculate the Authorization value, see Include a signature in the header.The Authorization header is typically required. However, you do not need to include this header if you include the signature in the URL. For more information, see Include a signature in the URL.Default value: none |
| Cache-Control | String | No | no-cache | Specifies the caching behavior when an object is downloaded. Valid values:no-cache: The cache must re-validate the content with the origin server before serving it. If the content has changed, the server returns the new object. Otherwise, it confirms the cached version is still valid. no-store: All content of the object is not cached. public: All content of the object is cached. private: All content of the object is cached only on the client. max-age=<seconds>: The validity period of the cached content. Unit: seconds. This option is available only in HTTP 1.1. Default value: none |
| Content-Disposition | String | No | attachment | Specifies how the object is displayed. Valid values:Content-Disposition:inline: The object is displayed directly in the browser. Content-Disposition:attachment: The object is downloaded to the specified download path of the browser with the original object name. Content-Disposition:attachment; filename="yourFileName": The object is downloaded to the specified download path of the browser with a custom object name. yourFileName specifies the custom name of the downloaded object, such as example.jpg. If you want to download the object to the specified download path of the browser, take note of the following items:Note If the name of the object contains special characters such as asterisks (*) or forward slashes (/), the name of the downloaded object may be escaped. For example, if you download example*.jpg to your local computer, example*.jpg may be escaped as example_.jpg. To ensure that object names containing non-ASCII characters (like Chinese) are correctly handled during download and do not result in garbled filenames, you must URL-encode the Chinese characters in the object name. For example, to ensure that the Test.txt object in OSS is downloaded as a local file that has the original object name Test.txt, you must set the Content-Disposition header to attachment;filename=%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt;filename*=UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt, which derives from "attachment;filename="+URLEncoder.encode("Test","UTF-8")+".txt;filename*=UTF-8''"+URLEncoder.encode("Test","UTF-8")+".txt". Whether an object is previewed or downloaded as an attachment when the object is accessed by using the object URL is determined by the creation time of the bucket in which the object is stored, the activation time of OSS, and the domain name type. For more information, see What do I do if an image object is downloaded as an attachment but cannot be previewed when I access the image object by using its URL? Default value: none |
| Content-Encoding | String | No | identity | Declares the codec of the object. You must specify the actual codec of the object. Otherwise, parsing or download failures may occur on the client. If the object is not encoded, leave this header empty. Valid values:identity (default): OSS does not compress or encode the object. gzip: OSS uses the LZ77 compression algorithm created by Lempel and Ziv in 1977 and 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to encode the object. compress: OSS uses the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) compression algorithm to encode the object. deflate: OSS uses the zlib library and the deflate algorithm to encode the object. br: OSS uses the Brotli algorithm to encode the object. Default value: none |
| Content-MD5 | String | No | eB5eJF1ptWaXm4bijSPyxw== | Used to check the integrity of the message content. Content-MD5 is a value generated by the MD5 algorithm. If you set this header, OSS calculates the Content-MD5 hash of the message body and checks for consistency. For more information, see How to calculate Content-MD5. To ensure data integrity, OSS provides multiple methods to verify the MD5 hash of data. To perform MD5 verification using Content-MD5, add the Content-MD5 header to the request.Default value: none |
| Content-Length | String | No | 344606 | The size of the HTTP message body to be transferred, in bytes.If the value of the Content-Length header is smaller than the actual size of the data transferred in the request body, OSS still creates the object. However, the object size will be equal to the size defined in Content-Length, and the excess data is discarded. |
| Expires | String | No | Wed, 08 Jul 2015 16:57:01 GMT | Specifies the expiration time of the object. For more information, see RFC2616.Default value: none |
| x-oss-forbid-overwrite | String | No | false | Specifies whether to overwrite an object that has the same name during a PutObject operation. If the destination bucket has versioning enabled or suspended, the x-oss-forbid-overwrite request header is invalid. This means that an object with the same name can be overwritten.If you do not specify x-oss-forbid-overwrite or set x-oss-forbid-overwrite to false, an object with the same name can be overwritten.If you set x-oss-forbid-overwrite to true, an object with the same name cannot be overwritten.Setting the x-oss-forbid-overwrite request header affects QPS performance. If many operations (QPS>1000) require the x-oss-forbid-overwrite request header, contact technical support to prevent impacts on your business operations.Default value: false |
| x-oss-server-side-encryption | String | No | AES256 | Specifies the server-side encryption method when you create an object. Valid values: AES256, KMS, If you specify this header, it is returned in the response header. OSS encrypts and stores the uploaded object. When you download the object, the response header includes x-oss-server-side-encryption, and its value is set to the encryption algorithm of the object. |
| x-oss-server-side-encryption-key-id | String | No | 9468da86-3509-4f8d-a61e-6eab1eac | The ID of the customer master key (CMK) that is managed by KMS. This header is valid only when x-oss-server-side-encryption is set to KMS. |
| x-oss-object-acl | String | No | default | Specifies the access permissions of the object when it is created in OSS.Valid values:default: The object inherits the access permissions of the bucket.private: The object is a private resource. Only the object owner and authorized users have read and write permissions on the object. Other users cannot access the object.public-read: The object is a public-read resource. Only the object owner and authorized users have read and write permissions on the object. Other users have only read permissions. Use this permission with caution.public-read-write: The object is a public-read-write resource. All users have read and write permissions on the object. Use this permission with caution.For more information about access permissions, see Object ACL. |
| x-oss-storage-class | String | No | Standard | Specifies the storage class of the object. For a bucket of any storage class, if you specify this parameter when you upload an object, the object is stored in the specified class. For example, if you set x-oss-storage-class to Standard when you upload an object to an Infrequent Access (IA) bucket, the object is stored as a Standard object.Valid values:Standard: StandardIA: Infrequent AccessArchive: Archive StorageColdArchive: Cold ArchiveDeepColdArchive: Deep Cold ArchiveImportant Setting the storage class to Deep Cold Archive during upload incurs higher PUT request fees. We recommend that you set the storage classes of the objects to Standard when you upload the objects, and configure lifecycle rules to convert the storage classes of the Standard objects to Deep Cold Archive. This reduces PUT request fees. For more information, see Storage classes. |
| x-oss-meta-* | String | No | x-oss-meta-location | When you use the PutObject API, parameters prefixed with x-oss-meta- are considered user-defined metadata, such as x-oss-meta-location. An object can have multiple such parameters, but the total size of all metadata cannot exceed 8 KB. Metadata supports hyphens (-), numbers, and lowercase letters (a-z). Uppercase letters are converted to lowercase. Other characters, including underscores (_), are not supported. |
| x-oss-tagging | String | No | TagA=A&TagB=B | Specifies tags for the object in a key-value format. You can set multiple tags at the same time, such as TagA=A&TagB=B.Note The key and value must be URL-encoded. The key is required, but the value is optional. For example, you can set the object tags to TagA&TagB=B. |

| Error code | HTTP status code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MissingContentLength | 411 | The request header does not use chunked encoding or the Content-Length parameter is not set. |
| InvalidEncryptionAlgorithmError | 400 | The value specified for x-oss-server-side-encryption is invalid. Valid values: AES256, KMS, . |
| AccessDenied | 403 | The user does not have the required access permissions for the specified bucket when adding the object. |
| NoSuchBucket | 404 | The specified bucket does not exist when adding the object. |
| InvalidObjectName | 400 | The object name is invalid. This can be because the object name is not specified, exceeds the length limit, or is invalid. |
| InvalidArgument | 400 | This error can be returned for the following reasons:The size of the object to be added exceeds 5 GB.The value of a parameter such as x-oss-storage-class is invalid. |
| RequestTimeout | 400 | Content-Length is specified, but no message body is sent, or the sent message body is smaller than the specified size. In this case, the server waits until the request times out. |
| Bad Request | 400 | If you specify Content-MD5 in the request, OSS calculates the MD5 hash of the sent data and compares it with the value of Content-MD5 in the request. If the two values do not match, this error is returned. |
| KmsServiceNotEnabled | 403 | You specified KMS for x-oss-server-side-encryption but have not purchased a KMS suite in advance. |
| FileAlreadyExists | 409 | Possible causes:The request header includes x-oss-forbid-overwrite=true to prevent overwriting a file with the same name, but a file with the same name already exists in the bucket.The hierarchical namespace feature is enabled for the bucket, and a directory with the same name already exists at the current directory level. |
| FileImmutable | 409 | This error is returned if you attempt to delete or modify data in a bucket that is in a protected state. |

ossutil command line interface


For the ossutil command that corresponds to the PutObject API, see [put-object](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/put-object).

## FAQ

#### How do I modify the metadata of an uploaded file?


You can modify file metadata using the OSS console, ossbrowser, SDKs for different languages, the ossutil command line interface, or the REST API. For example, you can change the Content-Type from application/octet-stream to image/jpeg. For more information, see [Manage object metadata](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/manage-object-metadata-10/#concept-lkf-swy-5db).

#### Why is the Expires header I set not working?


-

Cache header priority


If you set both `Expires` and `Cache-Control`, `Cache-Control` has a higher priority. If `Cache-Control` includes a caching directive, such as `max-age=3600`, the `Expires` header may be ignored.

-

`Expires`Incorrect setting


The value of the Expires header must be a future time in GMT format. The following code provides an example of how to set this header using the Node.js SDK:


`nodejs
const OSS = require('ali-oss');

// Create an OSS client instance.
const client = new OSS({
  // Replace yourregion with the region where the bucket is located. For example, if the bucket is in the China (Hangzhou) region, set the Region to oss-cn-hangzhou.
  region: 'yourregion',
  // Obtain access credentials from environment variables. Before running this example, make sure that the OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET environment variables are set.
  accessKeyId: process.env.OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  accessKeySecret: process.env.OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET,
  // Specify the bucket name.
  bucket: 'examplebucket',
});

async function setExpires(objectName, expiresDate) {
  try {
    const result = await client.copy(objectName, objectName, {
      meta: {
        'Expires': expiresDate.toGMTString()
      }
    });
    console.log('Expires header set successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error setting Expires header:', error);
  }
}

// Set the absolute expiration time for the cached content.
const expiresDate = new Date('2024-10-12T00:00:00.000Z');
setExpires('your-object-name', expiresDate);
`
