# GetBucketTransferAcceleration

You can call this operation to query the transfer acceleration configurations of a bucket.

Only the owner of a bucket or RAM users granted with the oss:PutBucketTransferAcceleration permission can initiate requests to query the transfer acceleration configurations of a bucket.

-

If transfer acceleration is not configured for the bucket to which you send the GetBucketTransferAcceleration request, no configurations are returned.
