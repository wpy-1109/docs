# Call RestoreObject to restore an object

If you do not enable real-time access of Archive objects, you can access Archive objects only after you restore them. Real-time access of Archive objects is not supported for Cold Archive and Deep Cold Archive objects. You can access Cold Archive and Deep Cold Archive objects only after you restore them. The following access operations are supported: GetObject, ProcessImage, CopyObject, UploadPartCopy, SelectObject, and PostProcessTask. This topic describes how to restore Archive, Cold Archive, and Deep Cold Archive objects to access these objects.

## Prerequisites


-

The storage class of the object that you want to restore is Archive, Cold Archive, or Deep Cold Archive. For more information, see [Storage classes](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/overview-53/).

-

You are granted the `oss:RestoreObject` permission. For more information, see [Attach a custom policy to a RAM user](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/user-guide/common-examples-of-ram-policies#section-ucu-jv0-zip).

## Usage notes


-

The RestoreObject operation applies only to Archive, Cold Archive, and Deep Cold Archive objects. This operation does not apply to Standard or Infrequent Access (IA) objects.

-

When you call non-access operations, such as `DeleteObject`, `DeleteMultipleObjects`, `GetObjectMeta`, and `HeadObject`, on Archive, Cold Archive, and Deep Cold Archive objects, you do not need to restore the objects. For the preceding operations, unnecessary fees are incurred if the objects are restored.

-

The first time you call the RestoreObject operation on an Archive object, a Cold Archive object, or a Deep Cold Archive object, the HTTP status code 202 is returned. When you call the RestoreObject operation on an object that is restored, 200 OK is returned.

-

If you call the RestoreObject operation on an object in the restoring state, the operation fails and the HTTP status code 409 is returned. After the object is restored, you can call the RestoreObject operation on the object again.

-

In a versioning-enabled bucket, the storage classes of different versions of an object can be different. By default, when you call the RestoreObject operation on an object, the current version of the object is restored. You can specify a version ID in the request to restore a specific version of an object.

## Process


The following restoration process applies to Archive, Cold Archive, and Deep Cold Archive objects:


-

Initially, the object is in the frozen state.

-

After a request is submitted to restore the object, the object enters the restoring state.

-

After the OSS server completes the restoration task, the object enters the restored state and can be accessed.

-

You can initiate another restoration request on the object in the restored state to extend the duration of the restored state of the object. The duration of the restored state of an object cannot exceed the maximum duration supported for the corresponding storage class.

-

After the duration of the restored state ends, the object returns to the frozen state.

## Restoration time


The following table describes the time required to restore objects in different storage classes. The given amounts of restoration time are for references. The restoration time may vary based on actual scenarios.








-


-


-


-


-


| Storage class | Restoration time |
| --- | --- |
| Archive | 1 minute |
| Cold Archive | Expedited: within 1 hour Standard: 2 to 5 hours Bulk: 5 to 12 hours |
| Deep Cold Archive | Expedited: within 12 hours Standard: within 48 hours |


## Duration of the restored state


The following table describes the duration of the restored state of objects in different storage classes.








| Storage class | Duration of the restored state |
| --- | --- |
| Archive | An integer from 1 to 7. Unit: days. |
| Cold Archive | An integer from 1 to 365. Unit: days. |
| Deep Cold Archive | An integer from 1 to 365. Unit: days. |


## Billing rules


-

You are charged data retrieval fees based on the size of the restored Archive, Cold Archive, or Deep Cold archive objects. For more information, see [Data processing fees](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/data-processing-fees#concept-2558464).

-

You are charged API operation calling fees based on the number of PUT requests when you restore Archive objects. For more information, see [API operation calling fees](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/api-operation-calling-fees).

-

You are charged data retrieval requests when you restore Cold Archive or Deep Cold Archive objects. For more information, see [API operation calling fees](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/api-operation-calling-fees).

-

You are charged storage fees based on billing rules for Archive, Cold Archive, and Deep Cold Archive objects during and after the restoration. For more information, see [Storage fees](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/storage-fees).

-

When you restore a Cold Archive or Deep Cold Archive object, a Standard replica of the object is generated for temporary access. You are charged for the temporary storage of the replica based on the Standard storage class until the Cold Archive or Deep Cold Archive object returns to the frozen state. For more information, see [Temporary storage fees](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/temporary-storage-fees#concept-2558617).

-

An Archive object can remain in the restored state for up to seven days. A Cold Archive or Deep Cold Archive object can remain in the restored state for up to 365 days. You are not charged data retrieval fees when an object is in the restored state.

-

After the period of time during which an object is in the restored state ends, the object returns to the frozen state. If you restore the object after it returns to the frozen state, you are charged data retrieval fees.
